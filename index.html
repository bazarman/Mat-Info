    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Mat Info! We are committed to providing you with detailed and accurate information about food contents. Your privacy is our priority, and we want to ensure that you understand how we handle your information.</p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Mat Info does not collect any personal information from its users. Our application is designed to offer information about food contents without the need to gather or store any personal data.</p>
        <h2>Use of Livsmedelsverket API</h2>
        <p>Mat Info utilizes the Livsmedelsverket API, provided by the Swedish Food Agency, to access and deliver information about food products. This API is a valuable resource for obtaining data related to food contents.</p>
        <p>Here’s how we use the Livsmedelsverket API:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Provided by the API:</strong> We use the API to retrieve information about various food products, including nutritional data, ingredients, and other relevant details. This data is used to provide you with accurate food information within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Data Accessed:</strong> The Livsmedelsverket API does not provide access to any personal information. The data received through the API is limited to food-related information and does not include any user-specific data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>Our app is designed solely to provide information about food contents. We do not gather, use, or store any personal data. The primary function of Mat Info is to present accurate food-related content to enhance your knowledge about the products you consume.</p>
        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Mat Info does not use cookies or any tracking technologies to collect data about your usage or preferences. There is no tracking of your activities beyond what is necessary to display the app’s content.</p>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Apart from utilizing the Livsmedelsverket API for food information, Mat Info does not integrate with any third-party services that require access to your personal data. Our focus remains on providing content and functionality relevant to food information.</p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to maintaining the security of Mat Info and the data it provides. Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal information at risk. We implement appropriate measures to ensure the security and integrity of the information delivered through the app.</p>
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or to comply with legal requirements. Any updates will be made available within the app, and we encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
